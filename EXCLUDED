2988.	[experimental]	Added a "dlopen" DLZ driver, allowing the creation
			of external DLZ drivers that can be loaded as
			shared objects at runtime rather than linked with
			named.  Currently this is switched on via a
			compile-time option, "configure --with-dlz-dlopen".
			Note: the syntax for configuring DLZ zones
			is likely to be refined in future releases.

3003.	[experimental]	Added update-policy match type "external",
