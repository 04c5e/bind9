3265.	[bug]		Address lock order reversal with inline-signing
			support. [27557]

3264.	[bug]		Automatic regeneration of signatures in an
			inline-signing zone could stall when the server
			was restarted. [RT #27344]

3263.	[bug]		"rndc sync" did not affect the unsigned side of an
			inline-signing zone. [RT #27337]

3252.	[bug]		When master zones using inline-signing were
			updated while the server was offline, the source
			zone could fall out of sync with the signed
			copy. They can now resynchronize. [RT #26676]

3246.	[bug]		Named failed to start with a empty also-notify list.
			[RT #27087]

3245.   [bug]           Don't report a error unchanged serials unless there
                        were other changes when thawing a zone with
                        ixfr-fromdifferences. [RT #26845]

3243.	[port]		freebsd,netbsd,bsdi: the thread defaults were not
			being properly set.

3225.   [bug]           Silence spurious "setsockopt(517, IPV6_V6ONLY) failed"
                        messages. [RT #26507]


3236.   [bug]           Backed out changes #3182 and #3202, related to

3233.   [bug]           'rndc freeze/thaw' didn't work for inline zones.
                        [RT #26632]

3223.   [bug]           'task_test privilege_drop' generated false positives.
                        [RT #26766]

3222.   [cleanup]       Replace dns_journal_{get,set}_bitws with
                        dns_journal_{get,set}_sourceserial. [RT #26634]

3202.   [bug]           NOEDNS caching on timeout was too agressive.
                        [RT #26416]

3184.   [bug]           named had excessive cpu usage when a redirect zone was
                        configured. [RT #26013]

3182.   [bug]           Auth servers behind firewalls which block packets
                        greater than 512 bytes may cause other servers to
                        perform poorly. Now, adb retains edns information
                        and caches noedns servers. [RT #23392/24964]

3172.   [port]          darwin 10.* and freebsd [89] are now built threaded by
                        default.

3166.   [bug]           Upgrading a zone to support inline-signing failed.
                        [RT #26014]

3160.   [bug]           When printing out a NSEC3 record in multiline form
                        the newline was not being printed causing type codes
                        to be run together. [RT #25873]

3136.   [func]          Add RFC 1918 reverse zones to the list of built-in
                        empty zones switched on by the 'empty-zones-enable'
                        option. [RT #24990]

3066.   [func]          The DLZ "dlopen" driver is now built by default,
                        no longer requiring a configure option.  To
                        disable it, use "configure --without-dlopen".
                        (Note: driver not supported on win32.) [RT #23467]

3045.	[removed]	Replaced by change #3050.

3011.   [func]          Allow setting this in named.conf using the new
                        'resolver-query-timeout' option, which specifies a max
                        time in seconds.  0 means 'default' and anything longer
                        than 30 will be silently set to 30. [RT #22852]
