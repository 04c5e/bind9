3460.	[bug]		Only link against readline where needed. [RT #29810]

3453.	[bug]		'rndc addzone' of a zone with 'inline-signing yes;'
			failed. [RT #31960]

3434.	[bug]		Pass client info to the DLZ findzone() entry
			point in addition to lookup().  This makes it
			possible for a database to answer differently
			whether it's authoritative for a name depending
			on the address of the client.  [RT #31775]

3433.	[bug]		dlz_findzone() did not correctly handle
			ISC_R_NOMORE. [RT #31172]

			found. [RT #31968]

			are now legal in slave zones as long as
			inline-signing is in use. [RT #31078]

3399.	[port]		netbsd: rename 'bool' parameter to avoid namespace
			clash.  [RT #31515]

3368.	[bug]		<dns/iptable.h>, <dns/private.h> and <dns/zone.h>
			were not C++ safe.

3361.	[bug]		"rndc signing -nsec3param" didn't work correctly

3316.	[tuning]	Improved locking performance when recursing.
			[RT #28836]

3315.	[tuning]	Use multiple dispatch objects for sending upstream
			queries; this can improve performance on busy
			multiprocessor systems by reducing lock contention.
			[RT #28605]

3303.	[bug]		named could die when reloading. [RT #28606]

3296.	[bug]		Named could die with a INSIST failure in
			client.c:exit_check. [RT #28346]

3289.	[bug]		'rndc retransfer' failed for inline zones. [RT #28036]

3279.	[bug]		Hold a internal reference to the zone while performing
			a asynchronous load.  Address potential memory leak
			if the asynchronous is cancelled. [RT #27750]

3277.	[bug]		win32: isc_socket_dup is not implemented. [RT #27696]

3275.	[bug]		Corrected rndc -h output; the 'rndc sync -clean'
			option had been misspelled as '-clear'.  (To avoid
			future confusion, both options now work.) [RT #27173]

3270.	[bug]		"rndc reload" didn't reuse existing zones correctly
			when inline-signing was in use. [RT #27650]

3269.	[port]		darwin 11 and later now built threaded by default.

3265.	[bug]		Address lock order reversal with inline-signing
			support. [27557]

3264.	[bug]		Automatic regeneration of signatures in an
			inline-signing zone could stall when the server
			was restarted. [RT #27344]

3263.	[bug]		"rndc sync" did not affect the unsigned side of an
			inline-signing zone. [RT #27337]

3252.	[bug]		When master zones using inline-signing were
			updated while the server was offline, the source
			zone could fall out of sync with the signed
			copy. They can now resynchronize. [RT #26676]

3246.	[bug]		Named failed to start with a empty also-notify list.
			[RT #27087]

3245.	[bug]		Don't report a error unchanged serials unless there

3215.	[bug]		'rndc recursing' could cause a core dump.  [RT #26495]

3210.	[bug]		Canceling the oldest query due to recursive-client
			overload could trigger an assertion failure. [RT #26463]

3202.	[bug]		NOEDNS caching on timeout was too agressive.
			[RT #26416]

3184.	[bug]		named had excessive cpu usage when a redirect zone was
			configured. [RT #26013]

3182.	[bug]		Auth servers behind firewalls which block packets
			greater than 512 bytes may cause other servers to
			perform poorly. Now, adb retains edns information
			and caches noedns servers. [RT #23392/24964]

3178.	[bug]		A race condition introduced by change #3163 could
			cause an assertion failure on shutdown. [RT #26271]

			concurrency problems with large numbers of threads.
			[RT #26044]

3160.	[bug]		When printing out a NSEC3 record in multiline form
			the newline was not being printed causing type codes
			to be run together. [RT #25873]

3159.	[bug]		On some platforms, named could assert on startup
			when running in a chrooted environment without
			/proc. [RT #25863]

3158.	[bug]		Recursive servers would prefer a particular UDP
			socket instead of using all available sockets.
			[RT #26038]

3136.	[func]		Add RFC 1918 reverse zones to the list of built-in
			empty zones switched on by the 'empty-zones-enable'

			warning messages; removed #ifdef ALLOW_KSKLESS_ZONES
			code (use -P instead). [RT #20852]

3066.	[func]		The DLZ "dlopen" driver is now built by default,
			no longer requiring a configure option.  To
			disable it, use "configure --without-dlopen".

			'resolver-query-timeout' option, which specifies a max
			time in seconds.  0 means 'default' and anything longer
			than 30 will be silently set to 30. [RT #22852]
