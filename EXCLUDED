			--without-gost" [RT #24367]

3103.	[bug]		Configuring 'dnssec-validation auto' in a view
			instead of in the options statement could trigger

			shared objects at runtime rather than linked with
			named.  Currently this is switched on via a
			compile-time option, "configure --with-dlz-dlopen".
			Note: the syntax for configuring DLZ zones
			is likely to be refined in future releases.
