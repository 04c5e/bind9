			will be prepended to it so that reloading works
			properly even when a directory option is present.

 897.	[bug]		A config.guess update changed the system identification
			string of UnixWare systems; configure now recognizes
			the new string.

 899.	[bug]		lib/dns/soa.c failed to compile on many platforms
			due to inappropriate use of a void value.
			[RT #1372, #1373, #1386, #1387, #1395]

			via rndc if the configuration file listed only
			nonexistent keys in the controls statement. [RT #1530]

 947.	[bug]		dns_rdata_soa_t had a badly named element "mname" which
			was really the RNAME field from RFC1035.  To avoid
			confusion and silent errors that would occur it the
			"origin" and "mname" elements were given their correct
			names "mname" and "rname" respectively, the "mname"
			element is renamed to "contact".

 948.	[port]		Integrated support for building on Windows NT /

			wrong epoch. [RT #1667]

 973.	[bug]		Failed to log the question name when logging:
			"bad zone transfer request: non-authoritative zone
			(NOTAUTH)".

 974.	[bug]		"max-cache-size unlimited;" as a global option
			was not accepted.

 975.	[bug]		"max-cache-size default;" as a view option
			caused an assertion failure.

 977.	[bug]		Improve "not at top of zone" error message.

 984.	[bug]		Multithreading should be enabled by default on

			status even though they were logged. [RT #1847]

1030.	[bug]		On systems with no resolv.conf file, nsupdate
			exited with an error rather than defaulting
