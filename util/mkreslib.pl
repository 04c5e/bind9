# Build a res_* library distribution from the BIND 8 source

#
# Usage:
#
# Export the BIND 8 source from CVS into a scratch directory,
# chdir into the 'bind' directory, run this script.
# Finally tar up the directory.  For example:
#
#   cd $scratch
#   cvs export -r t5b-823 bind
#   cd bind
#   perl $bind9/util/mkreslib.pl
#   cd ..
#   mv bind libbind8-9.0.0b5
#   tar cf - libbind8-9.0.0b5 | gzip >libbind8-9.0.0b5.tar.gz
#

# Don't bother keeping contrib or doc around in the new tarball
system("rm -rf Makefile contrib doc");
system("mv src/* src/.??* .");
system("rmdir src");

# We don't want bin/, conf/, tests/, or OLD/
system("rm -rf bin conf tests OLD");

# Move the old README away
system("mv README README.bind8");

# Make a new README
open(README, ">README") || warn "README: $!";
print README <<EOF;
This is the resolver library from BIND 8, provided for legacy software
needing access to these functions.  Programmers of new software are encouraged
to use the new lightweight resolver library instead.

See the README.bind8 file for the original README shipped with BIND 8.

close(README);

system("mv CHANGES CHANGES.bind8");
system("mv INSTALL INSTALL.bind8");

# The following files aren't useful here
system("rm -rf DNSSEC SUPPORT TODO");

# Massage the Makefile
system("mv Makefile Makefile.bind8");
