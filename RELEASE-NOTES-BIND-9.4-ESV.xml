			<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
A bug in NetBSD and FreeBSD kernels with SO_ACCEPTFILTER enabled allows
for a TCP DoS attack. Until there is a kernel fix, ISC is disabling
SO_ACCEPTFILTER support in BIND. [RT #22589]
</listitem>
<listitem>
named, set up to be a caching resolver, is vulnerable to a
user querying a domain with very large resource record sets (RRSets)
when trying to negatively cache the response. Due to an off-by-one
error, caching the response could cause named to crash. [RT #24650]
[CVE-2011-1910]

    <title>Bug Fixes</title>

			<title>9.4-ESV-R5rc1</title>
	    <itemizedlist>
<listitem>
Improved the mechanism for flagging database entries as negative
cache records; the former method, RR type 0, could be ambiguous.
[RT #24777]
</listitem>
<listitem>
During RFC5011 processing some journal write errors were not detected.
This could lead to managed-keys changes being committed but not 
recorded in the journal files, causing potential inconsistencies  
during later processing.  [RT #20256]
</listitem>
<listitem>
A potential NULL pointer deference in the DNS64 code could cause 
named to terminate unexpectedly. [RT #20256]
</listitem>
<listitem>
A state variable relating to DNSSEC could fail to be set during 
some infrequently-executed code paths, allowing it to be used whilst
in an unitialized state during cache updates, with unpredictable results.
[RT #20256]
</listitem>
<listitem>
A potential NULL pointer deference in DNSSEC signing code could 
cause named to terminate unexpectedly  [RT #20256]
</listitem>
<listitem>
Several cosmetic code changes were made to silence warnings
generated by a static code analysis tool. [RT #20256]
</listitem>
<listitem>
Cause named to terminate at startup or rndc reconfig
reload to fail, if a log file specified in the
conf file isn't a plain file. (RT #22771]
</listitem>
<listitem>
Prior to this fix, when named was was writing a zone to disk (as slave,
when resigning, etc.), it might not correctly preserve the case of domain
name labels within RDATA, if the RDATA was not compressible. The result
is that when reloading the zone from disk would, named could serve data
that did not match the RRSIG for that data, due to case mismatch. named
now correctly preserves case. After upgrading to fixed code, the operator
should either resign the data (on the master) or delete the disk file
on the slave and reload the zone. [RT #22863]
</listitem>
<listitem>
Fix the zonechecks system test to fail on error (warning in 9.6,
fatal in 9.7) to match behaviour for 9.4. [RT #22905]
</listitem>
<listitem>
There was a bug in how the clients-per-query code worked with some
query patterns. This could result, in rare circumstances, in having all
the client query slots filled with queries for the same DNS label,
essentially ignoring the max-clients-per-query setting.
[RT #22972]
</listitem>
<listitem>
Fixed precedence order bug with NS and DNAME records if both are present.
(Also fixed timing of autosign test in 9.7+) [RT #23035]
</listitem>
<listitem>
Changing TTL did not cause dnssec-signzone to generate new signatures.
[RT #23330]
</listitem>
<listitem>
If named encountered a CNAME instead of a DS record when walking
the chain of trust down from the trust anchor, it incorrectly stopped
validating. [RT #23338]
</listitem>
<listitem>
RRSIG records could have time stamps too far in the future.
[RT #23356]
</listitem>
<listitem>
If running on a powerpc CPU and with atomic operations enabled,
named could lock up. Added sync instructions to the end of atomic
operations. [RT #23469]
</listitem>
<listitem>
ixfr-from-differences {master|slave};
failed to select the master/slave zones, resulting in on diff/journal
file being created.
[RT #23580]
</listitem>
<listitem>
Remove bin/tests/system/logfileconfig/ns1/named.conf and
add setup.sh in order to resolve changing named.conf issue. [RT #23687]
</listitem>
<listitem>
The autosign tests attempted to open ports within reserved ranges. Test
now avoids those ports.
[RT #23957]
</listitem>
<listitem>
Named could fail to validate zones list in a DLV that validated insecure
without using DLV and had DS records in the parent zone. [RT #24631]
</listitem>
