.SH NAME
named-checkzone \- zone file validity checking tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBnamed-checkzone\fR [ \fB-d\fR ]  [ \fB-j\fR ]  [ \fB-q\fR ]  [ \fB-v\fR ]  [ \fB-c \fIclass\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-k \fImode\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-n \fImode\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-o \fIfilename\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-t \fIdirectory\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-w \fIdirectory\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-D\fR ]  [ \fB-W \fImode\fB\fR ]  \fBzonename\fR \fBfilename\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBnamed-checkzone\fR checks the syntax and integrity of
a zone file. It performs the same checks as \fBnamed\fR
does when loading a zone. This makes
\fBnamed-checkzone\fR useful for checking zone
files before configuring them into a name server.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Enable debugging.
.TP
\fB-q\fR
Quiet mode - exit code only.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Print the version of the \fBnamed-checkzone\fR
program and exit.
.TP
\fB-j\fR
When loading the zone file read the journal if it exists.
.TP
\fB-c \fIclass\fB\fR
Specify the class of the zone. If not specified "IN" is assumed.
.TP
\fB-k \fImode\fB\fR
Perform \fB"check-name"\fR checks with the specified failure mode.
Possible modes are \fB"fail"\fR,
\fB"warn"\fR (default) and
\fB"ignore"\fR.
.TP
\fB-n \fImode\fB\fR
Specify whether NS records should be checked to see if they
are addresses. Possible modes are \fB"fail"\fR,
\fB"warn"\fR (default) and
\fB"ignore"\fR.
.TP
\fB-o \fIfilename\fB\fR
Write zone output to \fIfilename\fR.
.TP
\fB-t \fIdirectory\fB\fR
chroot to \fIdirectory\fR so that include
directives in the configuration file are processed as if
run by a similarly chrooted named.
.TP
\fB-w \fIdirectory\fB\fR
chdir to \fIdirectory\fR so that relative
filenames in master file $INCLUDE directives work. This
is similar to the directory clause in
\fInamed.conf\fR.
.TP
\fB-D\fR
Dump zone file in canonical format.
.TP
\fB-W \fImode\fB\fR
Specify whether to check for non-terminal wildcards.
Non-terminal wildcards are almost always the result of a
failure to understand the wildcard matching algorithm (RFC 1034).
Possible modes are \fB"warn"\fR (default) and
\fB"ignore"\fR.
.TP
\fBzonename\fR
The domain name of the zone being checked.
.TP
\fBfilename\fR
The name of the zone file.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
\fBnamed-checkzone\fR returns an exit status of 1 if
errors were detected and 0 otherwise.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBnamed\fR(8),
\fIRFC 1035\fR,
\fIBIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual\fR.
