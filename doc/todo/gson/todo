Review these changes:

  ================
  cvs diff -r1.106 -r1.107 lib/dns/name.c

  Bitstring labels *still* suck.  They didn't somehow magically get less
  sucky in the past couple of months.  The nerve.

  Anyway, dns_name_split now correctly compacts the preceding bitstring label
  (if any) when a maximal bitstring is split.

  It also correctly creates the suffix when a maximal bitstring is split.
  It was doing this incorrectly before, independent of the compaction issue.
  ================
  cvs diff -r1.93 -r1.94 lib/dns/rbt.c

  date: 2000/11/14 23:51:24;  author: tale;  state: Exp;  lines: +82 -37

  Cope with the possibility that the prefix of a name split within a
  bitstring label might have been compacted to have fewer labels than
  what was expected
