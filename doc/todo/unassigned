Provide sample configuration files (root.hint, localhost.rev...)

Review man pages

write named.conf(5) man page

Complete server input code path security review
     message.c, tcpmsg.c + places where tcpmsg.c functionality is duplicated,
     request.c

Review lwres input code path for buffer overflows

Implement statistics similar to those in BIND 8

Write libdns overview document (even if it only says "don't use libdns")

Improve these error messages:
  rndc: operation failed: verify failure (failed to verify signature)
  rndc: reload command failure: verify failure

Do something about the commented-out interface scanning code in
getaddrinfo()

Add a built-in localhost zone feature

Sumbit the following change for the next revision of RFC2136:

<   7.12. Due to the TTL minimalization necessary when caching an RRset,
<   it is recommended that all TTLs in an RRset be set to the same value.
<   While the DNS Message Format permits variant TTLs to exist in the
<   same RRset, and this variance can exist inside a zone, such variance
<   will have counterintuitive results and its use is discouraged.

>   7.12. When adding a new RR to an existing RRSet, the server needs to
>   make sure that all the RRs in the resulting RRSet have the same TTL
>   [RFC2181].  The TTL of the newly added RRs should override the TTL
>   of the existing records.  In a server providing IXFR [RFC1995],
>   the IXFR difference sequence representing such an RR addition will
>   contain deletions of the existing RRs followed by their re-addition
>   with the new TTL.

Implement rrset-order (partially).  Mark says rrset-order is
applied first, sortlist last.

Support long command line options

Come up with a way of converting the XML docs to plain text

Add support for cross-zone glue

mark: explain "database file older than last load"

Review the use of debug levels and make it more consistent

Add configuration option for generating IXFRs by calculating the
difference between two zone versions (most of the code is already
there)

Examine why aa:/usr/var/adm/syslog.dated/22-May-17:37/daemon.log has:
  May 23 08:19:58 aa named[24603]: starting BIND 9.0.0b3
  May 23 08:19:58 aa syslog: loading configuration from '/build/gson/local/namedb
(why named then syslog?)

Define easy-to-parse subset of master file format and make dig support
it; make that the recommended way of exporting zone data.

Support general time specifiers like "4d10m" in named.conf

Stomp error memory leaks

Avoid ADB negative caching if an ADB-originated fetch fails due to a local
resource problem (e.g. ISC_R_NOMEMORY or ISC_R_QUOTA).

Write a paper on the flaws of DNSSEC

Improve logging infrastructure to simplify providing context information

Decide on one set of CHECK()/RETERR() macros and put it in a common
header file

Set up interoperability test server

Replace the calls to qsort() with a merge sort to avoid potential
stack overflow

Choose ixfr/axfr depending on zone/diff size

dns_db_createsoatuple -> journal_ ?

Support $DATE fully

Look at all the XXXes in the code

Persistent cache option

Make the ARM recommend separate auth/caching servers

From the old TODO file at the top of the source tree:

  1.	  Rdataset/Rdatalist Union
  3.      Finish mempool conversion of message.c
  5.      isc/util.h publish or perish
  8.      Check base 64 code; does it have the problems that
	  the BIND 8 code does?
  9.      Authority is optional if we have answers?
  11.     KEY duplication (answer + additional) in any query
  12.     Fix rdata META flag to be set for TSIG, TKEY, OPT
  13.     Intergrate (replace?) old per zone SOA timers with zomemgr
  14.     RWlock for zonemgr zone list
  15.     CHAOS A's
  16.     implement "doc" checks out of zonemgr.
