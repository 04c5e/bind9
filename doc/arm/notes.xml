	  Added the ability to specify the maximum number of records
	  permitted in a zone (<option>max-records #;</option>).
	  This provides a mechanism to block overly large zone

	  The ISC DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) service is scheduled
	  to be disabled in 2017.  A warning is now logged when

	  If an ACL is specified with an address prefix in which the

	  In future releases this will be a fatal configuration error.

	  Windows installs were failing due to triggering UAC without

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  A change in the internal binary representation of the RBT database
	  node structure enabled a race condition to occur (especially when
	  BIND was built with certain compilers or optimizer settings),
	  leading to inconsistent database state which caused random
	  assertion failures. [RT #42380]

	  Referencing a nonexistent zone in a <command>response-policy</command>

	  If a zone was updated while <command>named</command> was
