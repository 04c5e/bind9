  <section xml:id="root_key"><info><title>New DNSSEC Root Key</title></info>
    <para>
      ICANN is in the process of introducing a new Key Signing Key (KSK) for
      the global root zone. BIND has multiple methods for managing DNSSEC
      trust anchors, with somewhat different behaviors. If the root
      key is configured using the <command>managed-keys</command>
      statement, or if the pre-configured root key is enabled by using
      <command>dnssec-validation auto</command>, then BIND can keep
      keys up to date automatically. Servers configured in this way
      will roll seamlessly to the new key when it is published in
      the root zone. However, keys configured using the
      <command>trusted-keys</command> statement are not automatically
      maintained. If your server is performing DNSSEC validation
      and is configured using <command>trusted-keys</command>, you are
      advised to change your configuration before the root zone begins
      signing with the new KSK. This is currently scheduled for
      October 11, 2017.
    </para>
    <para>
      This release includes an updated version of the
      <filename>bind.keys</filename> file containing the new root
      key. This file can also be downloaded from

  <section xml:id="relnotes_license"><info><title>License Change</title></info>
    <para>
      With the release of BIND 9.11.0, ISC changed to the open
      source license for BIND from the ISC license to the Mozilla
      Public License (MPL 2.0).
    </para>
    <para>
      The MPL-2.0 license requires that if you make changes to
      licensed software (e.g. BIND) and distribute them outside
      your organization, that you publish those changes under that
      same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you made to our software.
    </para>
    <para>
      This new requirement will not affect anyone who is using BIND
      without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing it without
      changes, therefore this change will be without consequence
      for most individuals and organizations who are using BIND.
    </para>
    <para>
      Those unsure whether or not the license change affects their
      use of BIND, or who wish to discuss how to comply with the
      license may contact ISC at <link

	  <command>dig +ednsopt</command> now accepts the names
	  for EDNS options in addition to numeric values. For example,
	  an EDNS Client-Subnet option could be sent using

	  Threads in <command>named</command> are now set to human-readable
	  names to assist debugging on operating systems that support that.
	  Threads will have names such as "isc-timer", "isc-sockmgr",
	  "isc-worker0001", and so on. This will affect the reporting of
	  subsidiary thread names in <command>ps</command> and
	  <command>top</command>, but not the main thread. [RT #43234]

	<para>
	  Due to some incorrectly deleted code, when BIND was
	  built with LMDB, zones that were deleted via
	  <command>rndc delzone</command> were removed from the
	  running server but were not removed from the new zone
	  database, so that deletion did not persist after a
	  server restart. This has been corrected. [RT #45185]
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Semicolons are no longer escaped when printing CAA and
	  URI records.  This may break applications that depend on the
	  presence of the backslash before the semicolon. [RT #45216]
