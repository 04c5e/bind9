          When using native PKCS#11 cryptography (i.e.,
          <command>configure --enable-native-pkcs11</command>) HSM PINs
          of up to 256 characters can now be used.

          NXDOMAIN responses to queries of type DS are now cached separately
          from those for other types. This helps when using "grafted" zones
          of type forward, for which the parent zone does not contain a
          delegation, such as local top-level domains.  Previously a query
          of type DS for such a zone could cause the zone apex to be cached
          as NXDOMAIN, blocking all subsequent queries.  (Note: This
          change is only helpful when DNSSEC validation is not enabled.
          "Grafted" zones without a delegation in the parent are not a
          recommended configuration.)

          NOTIFY messages that are sent because a zone has been updated
          are now given priority above NOTIFY messages that were scheduled
          when the server started up. This should mitigate delays in zone
          propagation when servers are restarted frequently.

          <command>dnssec-keygen -S</command> failed to generate successor
          keys for some algorithm types (including ECDSA and GOST) due to
          a difference in the content of private key files. This has been
          corrected. [RT #37183]
