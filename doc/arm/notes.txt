Introduction

This document summarizes changes since the last production release on the
BIND 9.12 branch. Please see the CHANGES for a further list of bug fixes
and other changes.

each release, source code, and pre-compiled versions for Microsoft Windows
operating systems.

Security Fixes

  * When recursion is enabled but the allow-recursion and
    allow-query-cache ACLs are not specified, they should be limited to
    local networks, but they were inadvertently set to match the default
    allow-query, thus allowing remote queries. This flaw is disclosed in
    CVE-2018-5738. [GL #309]

  * The serve-stale feature could cause an assertion failure in rbtdb.c
    even when stale-answer-enable was false. The simultaneous use of stale
    cache records and NSEC aggressive negative caching could trigger a
    recursion loop in the named process. This flaw is disclosed in
    CVE-2018-5737. [GL #185]

  * A bug in zone database reference counting could lead to a crash when
    multiple versions of a slave zone were transferred from a master in
    close succession. This flaw is disclosed in CVE-2018-5736. [GL #134]

New Features

  * update-policy rules that otherwise ignore the name field now require
    that it be set to "." to ensure that any type list present is properly
    interpreted. Previously, if the name field was omitted from the rule
    declaration but a type list was present, it wouldn't be interpreted as
    expected.

  * named now supports the "root key sentinel" mechanism. This enables
    validating resolvers to indicate which trust anchors are configured
    for the root, so that information about root key rollover status can
    be gathered. To disable this feature, add root-key-sentinel no; to
    named.conf. [GL #37]

  * Add the ability to not return a DNS COOKIE option when one is present
    in the request. To prevent a cookie being returned add 'answer-cookie
    no;' to named.conf. [GL #173]

    answer-cookie is only available as a temporary measure, for use when
    named shares an IP address with other servers that do not yet support
    DNS COOKIE. A mismatch between servers on the same address is not
    expected to cause operational problems, but the option to disable
    COOKIE responses so that all servers have the same behavior is
    provided out of an abundance of caution. DNS COOKIE is an important
    security mechanism and should not be disabled unless absolutely
    necessary. The answer-cookie option is obsolete as of BIND 9.13.

Feature Changes

  * named will now log a warning if the old root DNSSEC key is explicitly
    configured and has not been updated. [RT #43670]

  * BIND now can be compiled against libidn2 library to add IDNA2008
    support. Previously BIND only supported IDNA2003 using (now obsolete)
    idnkit-1 library.

  * dig +noidnin can be used to disable IDN processing on the input domain
    name, when BIND is compiled with IDN support.

Bug Fixes

  * When answering authoritative queries, named does not return the target
    of a cross-zone CNAME between two locally served zones; this prevents
    accidental cache poisoning. This same restriction was incorrectly
    applied to recursive queries as well; this has been fixed. [RT #47078]

  * named could crash when acting as a slave for a catalog zone if zone
    contained a master definition without an IP address. [RT #45999]

  * named could crash due to a race condition when rolling dnstap log
    files. [RT #46942]

  * rndc reload could cause named to leak memory if it was invoked before
    the zone loading actions from a previous rndc reload command were
    completed. [RT #47076]

  * named could crash when rolling a dnstap log file. [RT #46942]

End of Life

The end-of-life date for BIND 9.12 has not yet been determined. However,
it is not intended to be an Extended Support Version (ESV) branch;
accordingly, support will end after the next stable branch (9.14) becomes
available. Those needing a longer-lived branch are encouraged to use the
current ESV, BIND 9.11, which will be supported until December 2021. See
https://www.isc.org/downloads/software-support-policy/ for details of
ISC's software support policy.
