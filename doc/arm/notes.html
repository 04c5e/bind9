    <p>
      BIND is open source software licenced under the terms of the Mozilla
      Public License, version 2.0 (see the <code class="filename">LICENSE</code>
      file for the full text).
    </p>
    <p>
      The license requires that if you make changes to BIND and distribute
      them outside your organization, those changes must be published under
      the same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you have made to our software.  This
      requirement does not affect anyone who is using BIND, with or without
      modifications, without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing
      BIND without changes.

<a name="end_of_life"></a>End of Life</h3></div></div></div>
    <p>
      The end-of-life date for BIND 9.12 has not yet been determined.
      However, it is not intended to be an Extended Support Version (ESV)
      branch; accordingly, support will end after the next stable
      branch (9.14) becomes available.  Those needing a longer-lived
      branch are encouraged to use the current ESV, BIND 9.11, which
      will be supported until December 2021. See
      <a class="link" href="https://www.isc.org/downloads/software-support-policy/" target="_top">https://www.isc.org/downloads/software-support-policy/</a>
      for details of ISC's software support policy.
